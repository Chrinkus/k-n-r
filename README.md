# The C Programming Language

After a studying C++ for over a year I felt it was time to learn the C-end of things. This text stands as the definitive introduction to the language so I begin my C adventure here.

*Jan 7, 2019 Update*

I've been having trouble making progress through the exercises in this text. My issues arise from some of the older methods of organizing code and writing facilities that already exist in the language (and having the compiler yell at me for doing so).

From this point forward (chapter 6 and onwards) I will no longer attempt to complete all of the exercises but instead focus on language features that I need to learn about to use SQLITE and the Socket API. I will also attempt to write in more of a modern style.

I'm considering folding my work here into a mono-repo of C resources.
