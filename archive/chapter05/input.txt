Why learn C?

Learning C++ first has made it difficult to understand where C ends and C++ begins. I know that C++ is "C with classes" but that seems to be only part of the story. So after gaining a pretty good handle on C++ I felt I needed to go deeper and learn the rest of the story.

C++ is apparently stricter about type safety, for starters. Type safety is not the sole domain of object oriented programming, so this is more than a "with classes" relationship.

Another programming tool related to type-safety is casting. C-style casts are near invisible and hardly self-documenting. C++ does away with potential ambiguity by making its casts big and ugly. Hard to miss and specific enough in the choice of cast to convey the programmer's intent.

If casting is more sophisticated in C++, generic programming, at least insofar as C is aware of generic programming, is a completely different animal. Void-stars are to templates as earth is to pizza.
